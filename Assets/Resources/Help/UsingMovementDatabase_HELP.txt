How to Use This in Your Unity Project
This might seem like a lot, but you only need to set it up once!

Place Your JSON: In your Unity "Project" window, create a folder named Resources. Drag your MoveDatabase.json file into this Resources folder.

Rename File: Unity won't see it as a "Text Asset" unless you rename it. Change the file name from MoveDatabase.json to MoveDatabase.json.txt. (This is a small Unity trick).

Create Manager: Create an empty GameObject in your scene. A good name for it is GameDataManager.

Attach Script: Attach the FighterDataManager.cs script to your GameDataManager GameObject.

Assign File: In the Inspector for GameDataManager, you'll see a "Move Database File" slot. Drag your MoveDatabase.json.txt file from the Resources folder into this slot.
